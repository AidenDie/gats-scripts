All my script related to gats.io

I quit gats on 6/22/2021. This repo contains all the scripts I wrote in my gats time. Some work, some don't, some are outdated. Enjoy.

# Scripts
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| bots.js | Earliest version of my bots. Stopped working once captcha was added because they moved to dynamic server urls. |
| hack.js | Earliest version of my hack. Contains a chatlogger but doesn't work anymore since the dynamic server urls. |
| killfeed.js | A design prototype of a killfeed system. Abandonned because noone was willing to use the client script (because they didn't trust me) which is required for it to function |
